### Project Description:

The Marvel Trivia game that I created was an assignment to illustrate my front-end development skills using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The main challenge was to utilize various methods to develop a trivia slide show based on a timer.

The game begins by pressing the start button which will immediately cause the first question to display. The user will have 10 sec to answer the question displayed with 3 possible outcomes:

    - The user selcts the correct answer
    - The user selcts the wrong answer
    - The user selects no answer

After one of the 3 above outcomes, a counter will show which outcome occurred and display the next question. This will continue until all questions have been answered. After all questions have been answered, a final display will show the number of each correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions as well as the option to start the trivia over again.

## Tech/framework used:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery
